# Python Labs

Hi! Welcome to the Python labs. The following two labs will help you gain some experience writing and running Python code.

To work on the labs, do the following:

1. `cd` into this directory.

2. Open the `.py` file corresponding to the lab you want to work on.

3. When finished, run `python <labname>.py`. If the lab was completed successfully, you should see a success message printed to the screen. If the lab has an error, you will see an error message instead.
