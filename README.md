Each of these bullets can be considered a "chapter", with each chapter consisting of a number of lessons. The first two lessons (through Git) will be primarily reading (with some examples to try). The remaining lessons will be coding-based and include scaffolded code samples for students to play with. The entire curriculum will consist of a GitHub repository. I'd like to leverage existing tutorials and resources, where appropriate.
