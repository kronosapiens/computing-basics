# Agility

For many years, software project timelines were organized using a technique which has come to be known as "waterfall". This term comes from the sequential nature of those timelines:

1. Gather requirements from end users
2. Design the software project to meet those needs
3. Implement the software project

Under the waterfall approach, these steps are performed in sequence.
