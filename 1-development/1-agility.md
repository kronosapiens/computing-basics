# Agility

For many years, software project timelines were organized using a technique which has come to be known as "waterfall". This term comes from the sequential nature of those timelines:

1. Gather requirements from end users
2. Design the software project to meet those needs
3. Implement the software project

Under the waterfall approach, these steps are performed in sequence. Over the years, programmers started to notice that the waterfall approach of software development often lead to the creation of pretty terrible software. After a lot of reflecting as to why that might be, the consensus developed that the problem was, ultimately, **that no one knows what they want until they've actually seen it.** People think they know what they want, but what they think they want and what they ultimately actually want are usually very different. The waterfall approach, in which users generally did not try the software until it was "finished", meant that users real needs were never actually discovered.

Out of this process emerged the idea of "agile" software development. The key difference between waterfall and agile approaches to development is that with the agile approach, software is seen as something that is, in some sense, "discovered". This discovery process is one of rapid and low-cost trial-and-error, in which simple prototypes are shown to users and their reactions are carefully gauged and used to inform further development. The term "agile" directly evokes the idea of moving quickly.

One of Facebook's mantras, "Move fast and break things", is an exemplar of this ethos.

Agile software development has become the dominant thinking in software development. Even institutions that are generally risk-averse, such as governments, are learning to embrace this more seemingly uncertain, but ultimately more successful, methodology.
