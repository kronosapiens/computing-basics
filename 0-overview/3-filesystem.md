# Files and Filesystems

Before programs can be run, or data can be read, they must exist somewhere the computer can access. Computers access information in the form of "files", or self-contained units of data. A file is a primary unit of organization for information on computers.

Putting aside computer networks and the Internet, we will say that these files must be stored "locally" on the computer's hard drive.
