# computing-basics
Basic curriculum for modern computing

Content:
1. Overview of computing (unix, command line, processes, files)
2. Git and GitHub
3. Data processing in R
4. Data processing in Python
5. The web: HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Each of these bullets can be considered a "chapter", with each chapter consisting of a number of lessons. The first two lessons (through Git) will be primarily reading (with some examples to try). The remaining lessons will be coding-based and include scaffolded code samples for students to play with. The entire curriculum will consist of a GitHub repository. I'd like to leverage existing tutorials and resources, where appropriate.
